## Why use Puzzle Pattern?

When you are working with several different developers in one single project, the code tends to variate a lot one file to the other.

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) usually helps us with that already. However, there are a lot of cases some linters may look the other way, when it shouldn't.

If you wish to maintain a code pattern throughout your entire project, with clean and organized code, that can also help with code maintenance, **this is the pattern for you!**

<a name="1"></a>
## [1](#1) MUST

<a name="1.1"></a>
* [1.1](#1.1) Use ES6 in full capacity;
<a name="1.2"></a>
* [1.2](#1.2) Set a default language to be used throughout the project. If it's not your native language, define all the words will not be translated;
<a name="1.3"></a>
* [1.3](#1.3) Define a code order inside your `<script>` that must be followed throughout all components. Only declare it if you are going to use it in your component. The recommended order is:
```javascript
  // imports
  export default {
    name: '',
    props: {},
    components: {},
    mixins: [],
    directives: {},
    data: () => ({}),
    computed: {},
    filters: {},
    beforeCreate () {},
    created () {},
    beforeMount () {},
    mounted () {},
    beforeUpdate () {},
    updated () {},
    beforeDestroy () {},
    destroyed () {},
    methods: {},
    watch: {}
  }
```
<a name="1.4"></a>
* [1.4](#1.4) Props must always be an object with a declared type;
<a name="1.5"></a>
* [1.5](#1.5) Props should be declared with lower `camelCase`. However, in the HTML they must be called with `kebab-case`;
<a name="1.6"></a>
* [1.6](#1.6) Pass a parameter method only when needed;
<a name="1.7"></a>
* [1.7](#1.7) Prioritize the use of `const`, otherwise use `let`;
<a name="1.8"></a>
* [1.8](#1.8) The `data ()` declaration must be like this: `data: () => ({});` or `data: vm => ({});` when you need to use a Vue instance property.
<a name="1.9"></a>
* [1.9](#1.9) If you wish to use the queryString when sending a GET request, use the `{ params }` object;
<a name="1.10"></a>
* [1.10](#1.10) The `export default` must be at the same level of indentation as the `<script>`. The same goes for the first CSS property inside the `<style>`;
<a name="1.11"></a>
* [1.11](#1.11) Remove all unused declarations, `vars` and empty tags. The same goes for the `<script>` and `<style>`;
<a name="1.12"></a>
* [1.12](#1.12) One line break after all the `imports`;
<a name="1.13"></a>
* [1.13](#1.13) One space always before and after a variable inside an interpolation;
<a name="1.14"></a>
* [1.14](#1.14) Double quotes in all HTML tag attributes;
<a name="1.15"></a>
* [1.15](#1.15) When a tag has more than one attribute, put on a line break;
<a name="1.16"></a>
* [1.16](#1.16) Put a line break after each dot inside your script whenever possible;
<a name="1.17"></a>
* [1.17](#1.17) When calling a method inside your HTML component, always put the parentheses "()";
<a name="1.18"></a>
* [1.18](#1.18) Only use `mapGetters` when you are manipulating the `state`;
<a name="1.19"></a>
* [1.19](#1.19) Moderate use of [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), only in cases when you need the same state in a few components;
<a name="1.20"></a>
* [1.20](#1.20) Using [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), always use `mapGetters`, `mapState`, `mapActions` and `mapMutations`, instead of `this.$store`;
<a name="1.21"></a>
* [1.21](#1.21) A [vuex's](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) action should always return a promise.

## SHOULD

* Use `computed properties` in your HTML instead of methods;
* Use `filter`, `map`, `reduce` and `find`;
* Create customized events rather than props with type Function which returns a callback;
* Use the `created ()` _Lifecycle_ rather than `mounted ()`;
* Use `v-if` instead of `v-show`;
* Use the `.sync` modifier rather than `v-model`;
* Use display flex rather than other types of display;
* Import your files with "@" rather than "../";
* Whenever you are going to duplicate a code, create a mixin instead and declare it locally.

## AVOID

* Using watchs, use computed instead;
* Using `var`, use `const` or `let` instead;
* Using `else`, prioritize early return;
* Using `switch case`;
* Using `forEach`, `for in`, `for` and `while`;
* Using the attribute `style` static in your HTML tags;
* Using `scoped` on your `<style>`, instead create a class and wrap all your `<template>` on it, then put all other class you have inside that one;
* Using the `beforeUpdate ()` and `updated ()` _Lifecycle_;
* Using the directive `v-html`;
* Using more than one props type;
* Declaring global filters;
* Declaring global directives;
* Declaring global components with `Vue.component()`;
* Treating Date as a String, use [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/) instead;
* Having several levels of indentation;
* In a request, avoid grabbing all of the `response`. Instead, grab only what you are going to actually use.

## DON'T

* Declare global mixins;
* Use the `v-bind` directive. Instead, use the short term (:);
* Use the `v-on` directive. Instead, use the short term (@);
* Use a `div` as an actual `div` using [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug). Create a class or id instead;
* Use `style`, `height`, `width`, and other __static__ attribute tags inside them directly. Create a class instead;
* Use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

### Code Style Recommended

This is the code style that was used to create this pattern and it's recommended to use Puzzle Pattern in its full potential.

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

### Template Engine Recommended

[Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) is highly recommended to use in all your `<template>` thorough your project.

### TODO

* [ ] Add code examples.
* [ ] Develop a Puzzle ESLint.
* [ ] Develop a Puzzle Editor Plugin.
